# Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)

**Dataset** : Iris https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

The Iris dataset consists of 4 features and 3 classes. WE Use only the first and second features and also delete the instances of the ’Iris-versicolor’ class to reduce the data to 2 classes with 2 features.
We Consider the first 80% of the data in each class for train and the rest 20% for test. We Report the training and testing errors, and the equation of the decision boundary.

### Decision boundary along with the samples of the two classes:
